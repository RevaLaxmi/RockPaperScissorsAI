# ðŸ§  Real-Time Rock Paper Scissors AI Game

This is a real-time **Rock Paper Scissors** game where you play against an AI opponent. The AI uses your **early hand movement patterns** to *predict* your final move and counter it.  

## ðŸŽ® What It Does
- Uses **live webcam input** to track your hand using keypoints.
- Predicts your move *before* you finish it using a trained ML model.
- AI selects its counter-move and plays **at the same time as you**.
- Tracks scores and ends after a best-of-5 match.
- Cleanish custom UI with fonts and restart button.

## ðŸ§° Built With
- Python + OpenCV
- Mediapipe (for hand tracking)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for move prediction)
- Custom UI using Pillow (PIL)

## ðŸ§  Concepts Involved
- Real-time computer vision
- Gesture recognition
- Sequence modeling
- Human-computer interaction
- Game logic & UX design
